This Java program implements a simple multi-threaded chat system consisting of a server and multiple clients communicating over sockets. The server listens for incoming client connections on a fixed port and starts a new thread for each connected client, allowing multiple users to join and chat simultaneously. Each client connects to the server, sends messages typed by the user, and receives messages broadcast by other clients in real time. The program demonstrates how to build a basic console-based group chat application in Java using sockets and multithreading to handle concurrent users efficiently.
